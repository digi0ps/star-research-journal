<p>Star Research Journal offer a double-blind peer review option where both reviewers and authors remain anonymous throughout the review process. All research articles are reviewed by at least two suitably qualified experts. Editors of SRJ will decide promptly whether to accept, reject, or request revisions of referred papers based on the reviews. All publication decisions are made by the journals’ Editors-in-Chief on the basis of the reviews provided. Editors will have the option of seeking additional reviews when needed. Authors will be advised when Editors decide further review is needed. We send reviewers’ comments along with the decision letter to all reviewers of that manuscript. If reviewers have identified themselves, this information will be passed on to other reviewers. We aim to make the review process as efficient as possible, whilst maintaining a high quality of reviewer feedback. </p>
  <p>Policy on Retraction of articles<br />
    The Journal follows the COPE guidelines for Retraction of articles: It can be found at following link:</p>

  <p>Plagiarism<br />
    Plagiarism is copying another person's text or ideas and passing the copied material as your own work. Plagiarism is considered fraud and has potentially harsh consequences. The SRJ will judge any case of plagiarism on its own merits. If plagiarism is detected, either by the editors, reviewers at any stage before publication of a manuscript- before or after acceptance, we will ask the author(s), to rewrite the text. If atleast 25% of the original submission is plagiarized the article may be rejected.</p>
